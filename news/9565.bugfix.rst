Make wheel compatibility tag preferences more important than the build tag

For example: if both linux_x86_64 and linux_i386 are supported and linux_x86_64
is preferred over linux_i386 the old behavior was to prefer
simple-1.0-2-py3-abi3-linux_i386.whl over
simple-1.0-1-py3-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl
but now pip prefers
simple-1.0-1-py3-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl over
simple-1.0-2-py3-abi3-linux_i386.whl
